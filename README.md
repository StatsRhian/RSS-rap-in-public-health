## Session abstract

Since 2017, analysts in the UK public sector have made their analysis more efficient and reproducible using a methodology called Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). They advocate writing analysis as code and using open-source tools, version control software, and dependency management. The Goldacre Review (2022) emphasised the importance of RAP in public health, and now seems like a good time to reflect on where we've come, showcase some of the good work done so far and share some advice and knowledge for future work. 

This session brings together a number of analysts from across public health to share stories of how they have incorporated RAP principals in their working practices and the benefits it has brought. 

The session will conclude with a 20 minute RAP clinic where our panelists will answer questions around the future of RAP.
